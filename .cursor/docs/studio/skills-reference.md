# Workflow skills catalog

Each workflow is a **folder** under **`.cursor/skills/<name>/`** containing **`SKILL.md`**.

## How to use in Cursor

- **Chat:** ask for a skill by name (e.g. “follow the `sprint-plan` skill”, “use `brainstorm`”).
- **Direct:** open `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and work through it step by step.
- **Rules for AI:** project rules in `.cursor/rules/` already route engine work; skills add structured workflows on top.
